“Our hearts weep for #CharlieGard,” the conservative senator Ted Cruz tweeted. 

The head of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, Arthur Caplan, called for politicians such as Cruz and Trump to put their money where their mouth is.

“Those such as President Trump who say they want to help Charlie should be telling us what they are budgeting to expand access to healthcare including both novel experimental interventions and proven treatments for all American kids,” he wrote in the Hill. “Anything less,” he said, “is just empty, feel-good, cheap politician hot air.”

As for Goff going 0-7 that argument would hold more water if i felt that the Rams were a QB away from being a good team. That team had a lot of problems. The other issue is that when Goff got his chance to play over CK the Rams never looked back. When Lynch got his chance to play they handed the job right back to Siemian. So I think the question is this:A)Do you play Lynch when he is healthy no matter what and just call it a season?
B) Or do you continue with Siemian and try to make the playoffs?
It depends on how the coaching staff sees the team. The Rams knew they couldn't compete with the Seahawks or Cards for the division title so going with Goff was a real option. Denver right now stands 1 game out of 1st place and have already beaten two division opponents. It might be tough to convince VJ that A is the better option.

I don't know why you are so concerned about a market downturn. As you've said, you are mostly and have been for years, in cash. A 30% downturn would not bother me whatsoever. And I doubt that it would bother many true income (dividend / distribution) investors. I can see though how such a decline might scare someone who needs a 10%+ return on their money to pay their bills and who relies solely on trading the market to make those returns. Especially when they won't go short. That wuld scare me too. But for those dividend investors who just cash their dividend cheques / checks or better yet don't need that money and reinvest it and who would benefit from a market decline, share prices don't mean a whole lot.

You are largely right. ""Metro"" has figured out, and now includes in their computer modeling software, that constraining  developable land increases housing costs and leads to shift in demand. Among the most important strategies to mitigate this is _pragmatic_ approaches to supporting alternative forms of housing (e.g., courtyard cottages) that can be profitable at a reasonable cost and that have function and features that appeal to at least some segment of the ""single-family housing"" market.

As I explain above, Eugene Planning staff have done nothing but produce marketing hype and a disastrous, sweeping zone change that would have accomplished nothing other than net loss of some affordable single-family homes in a close-in neighborhood.

Unless you uses the fundamentals the banks use, Housing Expense Ratio

What is 'Housing Expense Ratio'

A ratio comparing housing expenses to before-tax income that is used by lenders to qualify borrowers for a mortgage. The housing expense measure includes mortgage principal, interest payments, property taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance and association fees. The limit is generally 28%.

A 1.2 million dollar detached home with a 200,000 down payment, leaves a million dollar mortgage. At 2.94% (a rate soon to disappear) the monthly payment is $5,086.72. Add 500 for everything else. To get that mortgage the buyers needs a monthly gross of 19,952 bucks. 240Gs a year.

Some of the approximately 3000 members have planned various acts of violence, often directed at rival factions. Two Al-Fuqra members were convicted of conspiring to murder Rashad Khalifa in 1990 and others are alleged to have assassinated Ahmadiyya leader Mozaffar Ahmad in 1983.

The group itself is not listed as a terror group by the US or the EU, but was listed as a terrorist organization in the 1999 Patterns of Global Terrorism report by the U.S. State Department.

To offer minibus taxis or even metered taxis as a cure is just daft, especially if you take their track record into account.

 symbol of divine love and of human injustice, icon of the supreme sacrifice for love and of boundless selfishness even unto madness, instrument of death and the way of resurrection, sign of obedience and emblem of betrayal, the gallows of persecution and the banner of victory.

O Cross of Christ, 
today too we see you in the hardened hearts of those who easily judge others, with hearts ready to condemn even to the point of stoning, without ever recognizing their own sins and faults.


As an Ash Wednesday experience either in private or in community, it really turns the heart toward the
steps of the journey through Lent... repeat weekly? daily? as prayer, as an examination of conscience...

1. The nuclear waste problem has been ""solved"" scientifically since the beginning.  Remember, safe and as productive as they are, current reactor designs are inefficient users of their fuel (using at best about 2% of the available fuel).  Some argue that we should never have settled on the current designs, there being better designs (which consume all their fuel leaving tiny amounts of easily handled true waste) - but the history of nuclear power was that the designs which worked on submarines (and later other warships) were simply re-purposed for commercial use.  Not solved? In the minds of the ignorant perhaps but not to nuclear scientists.
2. Dangerous? Nuclear power is the safest source of electricity.

By the way, I would have no objection to female priests. However, my personal view (as a practising Catholic) counts for little in this matter.
My point is that having women priests will not be the answer to the problems of the Catholic Church in Ireland. The problems go far deeper than a shortage of priests. Have you read the article, or looked at the website of the ACP? The main problems seem to be a frontline priesthood which feels it has lost its place in Irish society (partly - but not entirely - the result of the abuse scandal); a local hierarchy which is mostly perceived as remote and unsupportive of the priests; and a papal nuncio who seems to be on a completely different page from most others.

Immediately upon addition to drinking water, fluorosilicates (FS) completely hydrolyze (dissociate) into fluoride ions, identical to those which have always existed in water, and trace contaminants in barely detectable amounts far below EPA mandated maximum allowable levels.  After this point, the FS  no longer exists in that water.  It does not reach the tap.  It is not ingested.  It is, therefore, of no concern, whatsoever.

FS has not been approved by anyone as a ""medical treatment"".  They are not ingested.

The  relative toxicity of FS is irrelevant.  They are not ingested.

Calcium fluoride (CaF2) does not occur in groundwater.  ""Naturally occurring"" fluoride is fluoride ions leached from CaF2 and fluorosilicates in rocks as groundwater passes over these rocks. These ""naturally occurring"" F ions are identical to those released by FS during fluoridation. A  F ion is a F ion, regardless the source compound from which it is released.

Seriously?  

This is the sort of silly hyperbole MD's have to deal with. Yes, some do own nice cars, but many do not, and no one deducts a beemer as a business expense.  That would be asking for an audit.  MD's deduct luxuries like rent, staff salaries (that lone receptionist who gives you an appointment if you can get through, that nurse who checks your BP),  office equipment (those stirrups!) and supplies (the very swabs that go... well...), the computers that hold your medical records, the pricey electronic medical record software doctors are required to use and specialty diagnostic equipment like x-ray, ultrasound and ECG machines.  Diagnostic equipment in x-ray starts at six figures and goes up.  No sensible person would pay such expenses out of take home pay after 53% tax.

That our soldiers, men of honor, of all races and ethnic background, Americans willing to sacrifice everything for this nation, walked our nation's flag into an arena of a sport with billionaire sports team owners, to be disrespected by multi-million dollar players, is beyond any forgiveness I will ever see fit to extend to the NFL.

An AP investigation last month found that in the last 12 years up to March, an estimated 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse or exploitation have been levied at U.N. peacekeepers and personnel. 

Not a single U.N. peacekeeper has been brought to trial or even been reprimanded. The U.N. has done exactly nothing.

It is not responsible for current climate change. Underwater volcanoes do not effectively heat the ocean, and they emit only a tiny fraction of the CO₂ emitted by humans.

We know from mass balance accounting and isotopic analysis that the origin of the increase in the atmospheric mixing ratio of CO₂ is us. And it is that increase in CO₂ that has caused modern warming.

One reason government has been unsuccessful in resolving homelessness (and its related issues) is because it doesn't want to appear ""insensitive."" So it allows people to consistently break the law. It also lets people camp and monopolize areas, which then become unsanitary and unsafe. Often in life, doing the nice thing and not the right thing leads to greater, unintended consequences.

In addition, when government does take the ""insensitive"" approach (which to the majority is sometimes needed) some people will deliberately mischaracterize its' actions for their own political purpose.

In turn, those fish runs promote recreational and commercial fishing opportunities which support sustainable and profitable industries. Year after year after year. Arguing against this reality is like spitting into the wind.

Mr. Young is correct on all points; economic benefits spread widely through the economy of well managed watersheds; water quality remains high (lowering filtration costs to muni water systems), natural fish productivity increases, and healthy forests encourage improved diversity of all species, which improves all aspects of human forest experience.

I say shrug it off. Many Americans will caution Trump about injuring American self-interest in trade. The real NAFTA bargaining is between White House and the US negotiating team (backed by many, many pro-NAFTA lobbyists.)

And the Pentagon will have lots to say to Trump about ""letting Canada defend itself."" (That is, after joint chiefs finish telling Trump how they feel about Qatar's fate...)

Secondly, the loosy goosy loan arrangements just look like a subsidy and attract retaliation (from US and Brazil).

The Federal and Quebec governments should take a more disciplined approach with Bombardier. Put assets up for collateral and establish a firm loan repayment scheme.
